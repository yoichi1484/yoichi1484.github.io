I am a researcher at NEC Corporation (Data Science Research Laboratories, Generative AI Group). My research interests lie in coding agents and self-improving LLMs. I believe the most economically valuable application of AI is automating technological development itself, and I have been conducting research toward this goal. In recent years, I have worked on [a scalable multi-agent system that distributes context to address context length limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02183); [a training method where LLMs iteratively discover algorithms and use reinforcement learning to find superior ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15639) (NAACL 2025); [automation of LLM development pipelines including SFT and merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21963) (EMNLP 2025); and [a domain-agnostic method for training reasoning capabilities during pre-training using arbitrary text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10182).

I graduated with the highest honors from Kyoto Sangyo University and received my Master's (2020) and Ph.D. (2023) from NAIST. After a one-year postdoctoral position at Kyoto University (2023–2024), I joined my current position.
