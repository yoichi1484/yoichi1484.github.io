I am a researcher at NEC (Data Science Research Laboratories, Generative AI Group). My research interests lie in `coding agents` and `self-improving LLMs`. I believe the most economically valuable application of AI is creating new technologies—that is, automating technological development—and I have been conducting research toward this goal. In recent years, I have proposed [a scalable multi-agent system that distributes context to address long-context bottlenecks in coding agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02183), [a reinforcement learning approach for iterative algorithm discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15639) (NAACL 2025), [methods for automating LLM development pipelines including SFT and model merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21963) (EMNLP 2025), and [a continual pre-training approach that enables reasoning training on arbitrary text without requiring verifiable problem-answer pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10182).

I graduated with the highest honors from Kyoto Sangyo University and received my Master's (2020) and Ph.D. (2023) from NAIST. After a one-year postdoctoral position at Kyoto University (2023–2024), I joined my current position.
